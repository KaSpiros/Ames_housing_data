# Ames_housing_data

## This was a coursework project completed for the course of Software Development for Data Science during my Masters year in Glasgow Caledonian University

### The dataset contains 28 columns and 2938 rows that cover details about housing in the Ames region.

Through this notebook we cover some methods of analysis and data manipulation before attempting to find trends and patterns that could help us predict future house price.
